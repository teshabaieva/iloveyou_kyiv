        The traditionally recognized year of Kyiv’s establishment is 482 CE, and
        in 1982 the city celebrated its 1,500th anniversary. However,
        archaeological evidence suggests that the city was founded in the 6th or
        7th century. According to the 12th-century chronicle Povest vremennykh
        let (“Tale of Bygone Years,” also known as The Russian Primary
        Chronicle), Kyiv was founded by three brothers, Kyi, Shchek, and Khoryv,
        leaders of the Polyanian tribe of the East Slavs. Each established his
        own settlement on a hill, and these settlements became the town of Kyiv,
        named for the eldest brother, Kyi; a small stream nearby was named for
        their sister Lybid. Although the chronicle account is legendary, there
        are contemporary references to Kyiv in the writings of Byzantine,
        German, and Arab historians and geographers.

        Many ancient tribes gathered around Kiev, and at the end of the 9th
        century the city became the political center of the Eastern Slavs. In
        the year 988 Christianity, introduced by Great Prince Vladimir, became
        the official religion of the Kievan Rus. This helped to strengthen the
        power of Kiev on the broader international arena. The organizing center
        of Kievan Rus, the first great Slavic state, Kiev arose in the ninth
        century as a commercial hub on the trade routes connecting Europe, the
        Eastern Christian empire known as Byzantium with its capital at
        Constantinople, the glorious Abassid Moslem empire ruled from Baghdad,
        and the Khazar state of the lower Volga and northern Caucasus. One of
        Europe’s major cities, Kyiv established diplomatic relations with the
        Byzantine Empire, England, France, Sweden, and other countries. And at
        its zenith in the eleventh century, Kiev was the ruling center of the
        largest political entity in medieval Europe and one of the world's most
        splendid cities. Its population for the year 1200 has been estimated at
        fifty thousand or more. By comparison, Paris had about fifty thousand
        inhabitants at that time, while London had an estimated population of
        thirty thousand.

        The long road to the independence of Ukraine began with Cossack military
        campaigns. In 1648-1654 Cossack armies, headed by Hetman Bogdan
        Khmelnitsky, Ukraine's Cossack leader, waged several wars to liberate
        Ukraine. In 1648, when the Ukrainian Cossacks rose against Poland, Kiev
        became for a brief period the center of the Ukrainian State. But soon,
        confronted by the armies of Polish and Lithuanian feudal lords, Bogdan
        Khmelnitsky sought the protection of the Russian Tsar in the Treaty of
        Pereyaslavl. After Ukraine's union with Russia in 1654, however, the
        city was acquired by Moscow. During a long period of domination by the
        Russian Empire Ukraine in the 17th and 18th centuries managed to
        preserve and enjoy some of its rich political, economic, cultural, and
        religious achievements.

        Kyiv suffered severely during the World War II, when many unique
        architectural and artistic treasures were destroyed. Earlier, in the
        1930s, the Soviet authorities systematically destroyed many churches.
        Extensive restoration of the after-war days has revived much of Kiev's
        historical and cultural heritage. Despite repressions, suffering,
        political turmoil, and ecological disasters, Ukraine's spirit and
        national identity have never died. On August 24, 1991, after the
        collapse of the Soviet Union, Ukraine proclaimed its independence. This
        was the beginning of the whole new period in the history of Ukraine and
        its beautiful capital.
